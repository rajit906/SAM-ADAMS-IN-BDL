# Experiments for the paper "BNN priors revisited"

## Which notebooks create which figures?

- Histograms of weights (figures 1, 2, A.2) are in `Plot_weight_histograms.ipynb`
- CIFAR10 googleresnet covariances, and fittings of lengthscale and dfs (figures 3, 5 and A.10), are in `Plot_CIFAR10_resnet.ipynb`
- MNIST coveriance matrices (Fig. 4) in `Plot_MNIST_convnet_covariances.ipynb`
- Tempering curves for different BNN runs in `Plot_tempering_curves.ipynb`
- Temperature diagnostics for the sampler in `Plot_temperature_diagnostics.ipynb`
