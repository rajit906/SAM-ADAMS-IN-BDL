## Experiments:

Motivating toy example with GMM (Numpy)

Bayesian Neural Network (Torch)


## Instructions to contribute after cloning:

### Switch out of branh and make a new branch:

git checkout main          # make sure youâ€™re on main

git pull origin main        # update it to the latest remote version

git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME

### Edit add and commit as usual:

git add .

git commit -m "Implement new feature"

git push -u origin my-new-branch


### To merge back into main:

git checkout main

git pull origin main

git merge my-new-branch

git push origin main
